A Simple responsive landing page project with Next.Js. The idea is based on making an online sports shop. It's just for the demo purpose in a short time that how the website gonna look like. I could use any library to make that image slider animation and also for the other stuff. But I choose not to create any dependency on this short time project. In the future To make this website on a larger scale, I could use library and functionalities in order to make a complete web service. For example, I can use AXIOS for fetching data in the frontend, or If it's about server sider rendering we know NextJs is the ultimate solution. I can use EJS for Server Sider template rendering. And also I could use NodeJs in the backend because it's gonna be totally a data-driven service. As database, I believe MongoDB/Redis would be the best choice for managing the users, credentials, records and products etc.



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
